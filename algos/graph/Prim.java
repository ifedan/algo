 * Given a connected and undirected graph,
 * a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together.
 * A single graph can have many different spanning trees.
 * A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted,
 * connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
 * The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
 *
 * A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
